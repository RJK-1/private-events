Associations project, done through The Odin Project
https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations

This project used many-many associations so that a user could own an event (alias: creator),
and an event belonged to a creator.

It also had users having many events through a join table (alias: attendee),
and an event having many attendees through the same join table.

The project furthered my skills in the MVC model which rails uses, 
aswell as Gems, including Devise, bulma (CSS framework), font-awesome, simple-forms.
